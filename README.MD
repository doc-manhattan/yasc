Yet Another Shitcoin (SHIT)

The Cryptocurrency market is flooded with poorly designed, badly implemented projects that are analogous to tacky, pointless websites with Marquee tags and custom cursors we saw in the early dotcom boom only good enough to turn into pump and dump schemes.

The goal of this project is to put these frankenstein projects and the developers behind them to shame.

Inspired by the philosophy of Linus Torvalds, Richard Stallman and the Linux community, there will be no ICO or premine or any other form of commercial incentives for the developers. So if you're looking to get rich quick, look to other shitcoins like TRON or EOS. But if you want to contribute to building something truely awesome and stirring some shit, stay tuned.
